Written by Brendan Halstead for the AP Computer Science Principles Create Task. 

Really fun game that exists for the sole purpose of foisting the glorious 3D Alonzo upon the eyes of the unsuspecting AP graders.
Written to work with an Xbox One controller connected via USB. Further modification will probably be needed to function on another machine. 
Use xboxTest.py to help with that.

Collision detection is blatantly bugged, and the levels are designed (if one could refer to it as such) with that in mind. The first map is decent, the others
are terrible and need to be redesigned. Enjoy.
